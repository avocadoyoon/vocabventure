# 🧩 Word Guessing Game — _Gen Z Edition_
A fun, sassy terminal-based word guessing game written in Python. Inspired by Gen Z slang and aesthetics, this game lets you guess mystery words like “rizz,” “slay,” and even “skibidi.” Think hangman, but with ✨vibes✨.

<br>

## 🎮 How to Play
- The game picks a random word from a quirky word bank (yes, “_meow_” is in there).
  
- You get 8 attempts to guess the word one letter at a time.

- If you guess a correct letter, it’s revealed in the word.
  
- If you guess wrong... oof, you lose an attempt.

The game ends when:

  → You guess all the letters = you win 🎉
  
  → You run out of attempts = you lose 💀
